The MyToken contract contains features to mint (make) and burn (destroy) tokens, as well as defining a basic token with a name and symbol, tracking individual balances, and total supply tracking. External interaction is made possible via the public variables and functions, which enable managing token balances and querying the token's information.
We have declared three variables:-
i)tokenname:- stores the name of token
ii) tokenabbr:- stores the token abbreviation
iii) totalsupply:-Keeps track of the total supply of tokens
Mapping:-
Balances: Keeps track of individual balances of token holders.
We have created two functions:-
i) mint :- allows the creation of new tokens
ii) burn:- allows the destruction of existing tokens

This simple contract demonstrates fundamental token management operations.
